    "# Homework #2: Multiple Regressions and Assumptions of Regression\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) publishes county-level datasets on poverty, population, unemployment, income and Education (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/). Imagine you're working for the USDA as a Data Scientist and you've been tasked with putting together an analysis of the influence of education, in rural vs urban communities, on household income and unemployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The USDA defines the rural vs urban on a continuum from 1 to 9 with 1 referring to the largest counties (for reference, Cache Valley was listed as a 3 in 2013). The full scale is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Metro - Counties in metro areas of 1 million population or more                                               \n",
    "2. Metro - Counties in metro areas of 250,000 to 1 million population                                                   \n",
    "3. Metro - Counties in metro areas of fewer than 250,000 population                                                     \n",
    "4. Nonmetro - Urban population of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area                                             \n",
    "5. Nonmetro - Urban population of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area                                         \n",
    "6. Nonmetro - Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, adjacent to a metro area                                             \n",
    "7. Nonmetro - Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, not adjacent to a metro area                                         \n",
    "8. Nonmetro - Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a metro area                           \n",
    "9. Nonmetro - Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, not adjacent to a metro area\n",
