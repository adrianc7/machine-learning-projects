    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Are the coefficient estimate significant? What evidence is there to support your answer?***\n",
    "The coefficient estimate for the 'ALWAYS' (those who always wore a mask) variable is 0.1941 with a standard error of 0.059. The t-statistic is 3.275, and the associated p-value is 0.003. Since the p-value (0.003) is less than the typical significance level of 0.05, we can conclude that the coefficient estimate for the 'ALWAYS' variable is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***What proportion of variance in the response is explained by this model?***\n",
    "The R-squared value of 0.284 indicates that approximately 28.4% of the variance in the dependent variable \"cases_per_capita\" is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***How would you interpret the estimates of the coefficient?***\n",
    "The coefficient estimate for the 'ALWAYS' variable is 0.1941. This suggests that for every unit increase in the 'ALWAYS' variable, the 'cases_per_capita' is expected to increase by 0.1941, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***Does your model make sense intuitively? What could explain this result?***\n",
    "The positive coefficient for the 'ALWAYS' variable suggests a positive relationship between the 'ALWAYS' variable and 'cases_per_capita'. This means that higher values of the 'ALWAYS' variable are associated with higher values of 'cases_per_capita'. However, it's important to note that correlation **does not** imply causation, and further analysis is needed to understand the underlying factors driving this relationship."
